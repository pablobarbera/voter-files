# voter-files

This repository contains a set of python and R scripts to parse voting registration files in the United States into csv files with the same variables: 

- `voter_id`
- `first_name`
- `middle_name`
- `last_name`
- `birth_date`
- `gender`
- `turnout2008`
- `turnout2010`
- `turnout2012`
- `turnout2014`
- `party_affiliation_2008`
- `party_affiliation_2010`
- `party_affiliation_2012`
- `party_affiliation_2014`
- `party_affiliation` (current)
- `residential_address`
- `zipcode`
- `race`, `ethnicity` (in Florida and North Carolina)

When any of these variables is not available, that column will be left empty (`NA`). The idea is to be able to easily merge all these files if so desired.

Pull requests, comments, and suggestions are very welcome!
